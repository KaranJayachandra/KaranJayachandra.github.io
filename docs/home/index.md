I am an **Electrical Engineer** wandering across the pale blue dot constantly searching for the next interesting opportunity. On this page, you can have a look at my bio, my qualifications or browse through my blog. You can also contact me via social media or email using on of the links at the bottom of the page.

# This is Me

My guiding principles in life are [Rationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationalism) and [Humanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanism).

> My passion for science is matched by the need to innovate for a better future.

# The Gist

I am a Tamilian born in Hyderabad and brought up in Kolar. I am naturally inquisitive, an unapologetic skeptic and have a thirst for knowledge. I am always looking for new avenues to learn and grow. I am currently on a well deserved vacation after completing by Master's Degree in Electrical Engineering from TU Delft.

# Leisure

I enjoy sports, especially badminton and have an on-again, off-again relationship with running. I also play snooker and chess ([challenge](https://www.chess.com/member/mrkaranj)). I listen to rock, metal and hip-hop music. I am a self taught campfire guitarist but plan to ditch the campfire title. I read both fiction and non-fiction titles when time permits. Authors that I like include Stephen King, John Grisham and Brandon Sanderson.
