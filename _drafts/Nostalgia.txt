Long gone are days of childhood past,
Never knew years flew by this fast.
It happened in the blink of an eye,
the game has begun, I have cast my die.
Nostalgia, the feeling makes me think,
of years that have suddenly begun to shrink.
I have lived he best years of my life,
have had all kinds of experiences in rife.
If I were given a chance to relive those days,
I wouldn’t change a thing, whatever anyone says.
I have never known a worry till now,
I think it’s because of my parents to whom I bow.
My family can be quirky at times,
but the love they give me, can’t be put in rhymes.
The friends I have are the best I could as for,
I’ve had many since a time long before.
I hope I’ve been as good to them as they’ve been to me
they are the best, if you meet them you’ll see.
I hope everyone is as lucky as I have been,
So take of the blindfolds and look at the world that is yet to be seen.
