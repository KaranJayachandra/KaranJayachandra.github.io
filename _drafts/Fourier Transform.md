# Fourier Transform
The Gist: If you would like to solve partial derivates easily or process data in the frequency domain, Fourier Transform is the tool you need. If you interested in reading more, please read more below where I also demonstrate with an example.

# The Basics
The Fourier Transform represents a sequence of numbers (which I will refer to as a signal henceforth) as a summation of sinusoidal waves. It terms of the mathematics, it finds the right combinations of sine waves that need to be added to create the original signal. A sine wave however has two defining properties, the amplitude and the phase. Therefore, the Fourier transform calculates not only the amplitudes of the individual sine waves that make up the signal but also the phase of the waves. This makes the result of the Fourier transform a complex valued result. The Fourier transform can be calculated with the output containing different number of sine waves. For a more accurate description, in most cases, more sine waves are necessary. In the below diagram, this is demonstrated. The original sequence is approximated using the different number of sine waves. As you can see, the more the number of sine waves, the closer it is to the original sequence.
