Sometimes I wonder about what I am here for,
and when I am long gone will people sing my lore.
What is life and how do you climb the summit of this tor ?
or will I be another story that will just be a bore.

Should I aspire to be someone whose exploits are well known,
whose stories give inspiration to millions and many more ?
Or should I be the person whose achievements are his own,
another grain in the sand on the beautiful golden sea shore.

Aurelius rightly said, “One should have a good life”,
become immortal through the ideals and memories you leave behind.
Live a life with friends and family and have joy in rife,
your thoughts and actions stay on, thought you turn to grind.

But there are those who want to be well known even in stranger’s eyes,
those who want to change the course of history through words and act,
these men desire power and money, and these things are surely nice,
I understand how they feel and surely what they are getting at.

I am half way down the middle among the two paths I talked about,
I keep dreaming, that there must be some kind of middle ground.
What if I can have privacy of home and also be an icon standing stout ?
this is just a fantasy and for proof you just have to look around.

This choice is one that everybody has to make and before it’s too late,
else they might end up with nothing, even with potential great/
Carefully weigh the options and decide and stick with the road you take,
and hopefully this poem will act as a beacon for the decision you have to make.
