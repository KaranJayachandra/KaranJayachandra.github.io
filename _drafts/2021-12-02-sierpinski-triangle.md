I came across this YouTube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbKtFN71Lfs) where the concept of a [Sierpiński triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle) was explained in layman's terms. I became interested and wanted to test it out myself. I quickly wrote a python script as shown below and lo and behold, I could replicate what was explained in the video as shown in the diagram at the end of this post.
