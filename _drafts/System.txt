The whole education system is messed up,
I have no idea how much water is in my cup.
Am I the only one who wants to change this ?
It’s like these hacks are aiming to miss.
I know it is a difficult task at hand,
but someone somewhere must make a stand.
Rote learning is worshiped in today’s class.
Wait, is this class, or some Sunday mass.
Science is the epitome of reason and thinking,
religious fools know not what they are sinking.
An enemy of logic is the enemy of mankind.
And come what may, I will speak my mind.
They interfere in matters they know nothing about,
they are on the loosing side, they are soon to find out.
Start thinking about this before it’s too late,
we are not going anywhere at this lousy rate.
But before that we must admit that we have a problem,
without which how can we all sit down and solve them.
