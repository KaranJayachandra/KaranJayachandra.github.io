I see a lot of grief and sorrow,
but I still hope for a better tomorrow.
Hope helps a man of the world bear,
Woes and troubles amidst all despair.

Some see darkness through all the light,
others see light thought the darkness, bright.
People have gone through hardships in rife,
they never complain, because that’s just life.

These are the people who persevere and fight,
and also always keep their goal in sight.
This is why they are rewarded at the end,
but others think their success is godsend.

But in truth god had nothing do with it,
it was just one man working bit by bit.
No one knows all the failed attempts made,
he broke the constructs, others just obeyed.
Someone said, “Only failure is not to try”,
Never gave up, he would rather just die.
