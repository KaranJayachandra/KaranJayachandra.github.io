At times I sit and wonder,
what awaits us I ponder.
Then I am suddenly brought,
to present where forever I am caught,
the future, we can’t control,
take life through it’s treacherous shoal.
In thoughts of future unknown,
we can be happy or cry and moan,
but none of that really matters,
as any future good or bad,
like glass can at any time shatter.
