# Preface
The assumption of the book is that all human experience comes from us, nothing about it can be hidden from us. Not even the meaning of life. It posits that the purpose in life is to find the purpose of our lives. It says that there is meaning to life but we need to find it ourselves, rationally.

# The Meaning of Life
When people aren't eking out a living, they ask themselves the meaning of life. Either it has meaning or is just a joy ride. *The author here assumes that we want meaning to life which I don't agree with, there can be no evidence for this.* If we assume that it has meaning, we would like to know this purpose to try to fulfill it. Age and death help frame the context in which this question is asked. Without death, we would need to ask this question we can continue doing what we are doing and eventually fulfill its meaning. Death is the exact negation of life in that it terminates all experience. From this we could say that the meaning of life has answers in the things we experience during our lifetime. The difference between good and bad lives could be the kind of experience that fill them. Another compounding factor is that death always arrives when we don't expect it which doesn't allow for closure. Suicide is one attempt to rectify that. Here the author says that the difference between suicide and self-sacrifice is the intentionality of it. One is the affirmation of living and commitment to social community while the other is a selfish attempt to grab at personal meaning. *Here again I disagree with the author, this argument is a cop out when we assume there is meaning to life. If there isn't, there is no purpose that can ascribed to it. More over, why does one have to an affirmation to the living?* Most people in the world believe that the purpose of life is to earn entry to heaven. We have no evidence for this so we cannot follow this line of reasoning. Even the concept of reincarnation also just multiplies the problem into finding the meaning of life for each cycle. The most popular proposed answers to where we could get answers to the question are listed as:
- God/Aliens: This is a non-answer.
- Everything: This theory is called **Panpsychism** which ascribes meaning to all things living or not. Which just says that the meaning of life is to exist. Not very helpful.
- Science: This can answers the whys of the world and not the hows.
- Social Context: The meaning of life is defined by the factors that make up the span of time of human history. This doesn't give meaning to the individuals.
- Myth: For quite a long time, myths and rituals gave meaning to the lives of humans.
- Human Behavior: If understand every aspect of why we do things, we can understand its meaning. Doesn't say what we should be doing from the authors point of view.
- Values: The author rejects this saying that, how do we judge that the values that have are the right ones?
- Negation: The question isn't worth asking. The author rejects this because the author assumes an answer exists.

*In general I reject some of the above rejections as they assume that life has meaning at an individual level. Not convinced why the *

A good answer according to the makes contact with the psychological experience as the meaning of life is a psychological occurrence. Looks like the author is squarely dedicated in finding the answers from his head. Doesn't really want to look at others. This book wants to give the answer and not provide alternatives.
