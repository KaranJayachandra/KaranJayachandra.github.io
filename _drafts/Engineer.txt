I just opened my eyes,
but the teacher is still in class.
He is really such a bore,
but he just doesn’t know that, alas.

Everyone is acting it out,
they are now experts at faking rapport.
No point in listening now,
that ship has already sailed from the port.

Why don’t they get it 
Can’t teach one who has no interest.
I am forced to be here,
This is really the worst, I don’t jest.

I could be elsewhere,
doing something with my time,
but here i sit and cry,
nothing else but to write this rhyme.

Attendance is a sin,
It’s like i am paying to be jailed.
In India, Education is a business,
No one has the interest, I assayed.

Become an engineer,
then become what you want.
This is the mindset,
rebel and say you just can’t.

A Nation of graduates,
yet we still have nothing to show,
be what you want to be,
only then talent in gush will flow.
