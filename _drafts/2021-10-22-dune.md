**NOTE: This review contains spoliers to the movie.**

Rating: ⭐⭐⭐

**The Gist:** Most shots in the movies are spectacular, few scenes needed better audio mixing with the dialogue being inaudible and the cast performance is laudible. However, the story barely keeps you engaged because of the slow pace.

# The Good

The movies has definetely left me anticipiating the next release of the Dune saga. The scenes in the movies are well though out. The cinematography by <> is on point with the scenes from Arrakis and other planets looking magnificent. The ambience set up by the music was great and kept me at the edge of my seat. It potrayed the sense of danger that always surrounded House Atreides.

# The Bad

The run time of the movie could have been cut down to two hours while maintaining the same amount of story. The storyline ends up just introducing few of the factions in Dune universe, House Atreides taking and losing control of Arrakis and Paul Atreides meeting the Frijman. The plot doesn't move as fast as it could and it seems that pacing was sacrificed to use the amazing B roll that was created. Most characters were forgettable including Duncan played by Jason Momoa because of the lack of screen time. The only notable cast in the movie were House Atreides, and Head of the Bene Gesserit.
