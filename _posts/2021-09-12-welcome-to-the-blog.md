**The Gist:** I would like to document my experiences in life and have started a blog. Please have a look at some of my entries if you are interested.

This is the first post to test the blog. More articles will follow soon.

I will mainly write about the projects I am working on, scientific concepts that I find interesting or about my passions. Please bear with me while I find my writing style and the motivation to write :). If you do have any suggestions, please contact using the links in the footer.

My motivation to write is to record my journey for posterity. I would like to live deliberately and blogging my experiences might make me think more consciously about the reasons I do the things that I do.]

If you like the way this blog looks or would like to start one yourself, you can find all the documentation on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the theme at [Jekyll Theme Console](https://github.com/b2a3e8/jekyll-theme-console). For more information on why I chose this format, read from the creator of the service itself [here](https://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html).
