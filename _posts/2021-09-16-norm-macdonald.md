**The Gist:** I enjoyed Norm's comedy and the world is a worse place without him in it.

If you haven't seen Norm's moth joke, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxD3pT8C9-A) you go. It's not everyone's cup of tea but it definitely deserves a chance.

[Norm Macdonald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_Macdonald) was one of my favourite comedians. His dry delivery and unique brand of comedy resonated with me. I was neither old enough nor exposed to Norm's earlier work at Saturday Night Live or The Norm Show. But I came across Norm when travelling through the YouTube wormhole. I was instantly hooked and couldn't get enough. His death has dealt a blow to comedy that may never fully heal especially when comedy is already bogged down with political correctness.

Rest In Peace Norm. You will be missed.

P.S. Please do yourself a favour and watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKmadR4Ye54) segment with Norm on a talk shown with [Conan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conan_O'Brien). I haven't laughed harder TV since.
