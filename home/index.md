## This is Me

I am an **Electrical Engineer** wandering across the pale blue dot constantly in search of the next interesting opportunity. On this page, you can have a look at my bio, my qualifications or browse through my blog which is both technical and non-technical. You can also contact me via social media, instant message or email using on of the links at the bottom of the page.

My guiding principles in life are [Rationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationalism) and [Humanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanism).

> I believe in striving to push the boundaries of science. But this is matched by the need to innovate for a better future.

## The Gist

I am a Tamilian born in Hyderabad and brought up in Kolar. I am naturally inquisitive, an unapologetic skeptic and have a thirst for knowledge. I am always looking for new avenues to learn and grow. I recently completed by Master's Degree in Electrical Engineering from TU Delft. I am currently working on the next generation of Automotive Radar systems for Automatic Cruise Control, Lane Change Assist, Blind Spot Detection and Cross Traffic Alert as a Radar Signal Processing Engineer.

## Leisure

I enjoy sports, especially badminton and have an on-again, off-again relationship with running. I also play snooker and chess ([challenge](https://lichess.org/@/KaranJayachandra)). I listen to rock, metal and hip-hop music. I am a self taught campfire guitarist but plan to ditch the campfire title. I read both fiction and non-fiction titles when time permits. Authors that I like include Stephen King, John Grisham and Brandon Sanderson.
